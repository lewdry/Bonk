# Bonk! ðŸŸ£âž°ðŸŸ¢
Bonk is a game of colourful, bouncing, bonking balls.

## Features
* grab a ball and throw it. 
* tap a ball to stop it. 
* double-tap anywhere to get a new set of balls.
* watch the bonk counter count ever upwards. 
* stop all the balls for a small surprise. 

Thrilling stuff. Hey, that's bonk!

## Use Cases
* just generally quite soothing.

## Philsophy
Sometimes you just need to bounce some balls.

A 'bonk' is defined as a ball to ball collision. Ball to wall collisions are not bonks.

In Bonk, there is intentionally no option to change the number of balls or size or balls or anything at all. I've found that having options is fun for a second but gets old fast. What I've published (15 balls, 10-30 pixels diameter) is the result of extensive market testing with a five and three year old. 

I will take no further questions on missing functionality.

## Sound
~~ In a previous python iteration of the game, I had a short audio file (beep.wav) play when there was a collision (or 'bonk') between two balls. Completely impractical. You'll observe how quickly bonks occur and the bonk counter climbs, the noise was near-constant. I have removed audio for your sanity and mine.~~

I have (at great personal effort) recorded my own series of collision sounds which I believe I have implemented in a melodic, comforting and not at all annoying way. For music geeks, I recorded the notes in Ableton Lite Live, using an Arturia Minilab Mkii, playing the 'Basic Analog Chime' instrument (with reverb and space set to zero). The notes are a G Major arpeggio from G2 to G4. I've been on a journey adding these sounds and I completely love the way it has turned out.

## Interesting Observation
The ball colours are randomly chosen on reset, but I have a deep suspicion that there are far more green balls presented than any other colour. I don't know how to prove or disprove it, but see for yourself. It's a very rare game of Bonk which contains 0 green balls. A very rare game indeed.

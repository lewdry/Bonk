# Bonk! ðŸŸ£âž°ðŸŸ¢
Bonk is a game of colourful, bouncing, bonking balls.

## Features
* grab a ball and throw it. 
* tap a ball to stop it. 
* double-tap anywhere to get a new set of balls.
* watch the bonk counter count ever upwards. 
* stop all the balls for a small surprise. 

Thrilling stuff. Hey, that's bonk!

## Use Cases
* just generally quite soothing.

## Philsophy
Sometimes you just need to bounce some balls. No option to change number of balls or size or balls or anything like that. It's fun for a second, but what I've published here (15 balls, 10-30 pixels diameter) is the result of extensive market testing with a five and three year old. I will take no further questions on this.

## Technical Info
* Built in plain old javascript.
* Hosted freely on github pages.
* The ball colours are randomly generated, but I suspect Bonk generates far more green than any other colour. I don't know how to prove or disprove that.

# Bonk! ðŸŸ£âž°ðŸŸ¢
Bonk is a game of colourful, bouncing, bonking balls.

## Features
* grab a ball and throw it. 
* tap a ball to stop it. 
* double-tap anywhere to get a new set of balls.
* watch the bonk counter count ever upwards. 
* stop all the balls for a small surprise. 

Thrilling stuff. Hey, that's bonk!

## Use Cases
* just generally quite soothing.

## Philsophy
Sometimes you just need to bounce some balls. No option to change number of balls or size or balls or anything like that. It's fun for a second, but what I've published here (15 balls, 10-30 pixels diameter) is the result of extensive market testing with a five and three year old. I will take no further questions on this.

In a previous iteration of the game, I had a short beep.wav audio file play when there was a collision (or 'bonk'). Completely impractical. You'll see through play how fast the bonk counter climbs, the noise was near constant. I have removed audio for your sanity and mine.

## Interesting Observation
The ball colours are randomly chosen on reset, but I suspect there are far more green balls presented than any other colour. I don't know how to prove or disprove it, but see for yourself. It's a very rare game of Bonk which contains 0 green balls. 

## Technical Info
* Built in plain old javascript.
* Hosted freely on github pages.
